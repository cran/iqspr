Description: Generate chemical structures possibly satisfying desired properties
 using the inverse QSPR model. It has three reference classes. ENgram is a class for learning the grammar 
 structure of existing chemical strings using an extended N-gram model. QSPRpred contains 
 a simple Bayes regression model to predict properties from structures. SmcChem is a class of the generator of
 chemical strings from the Inverse-QSPR model. This class has ENgram and QSPRpred class objects inside. 
 The generator is implemented by the Sequential Monte Carlo sampler.
